# Network Virus Simulation

Simulating and visualising how computer viruses spreading across a network
using compartmental models.

## About

This repository contains a notebook which can be used to simulate a computer
virus spreading across a network using the SIRV model. More details about
epidemiological compartmental models can be found on the [Wikipedia
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology).

## Requirements

This project uses Python (version 3.10+) and Jupyter Notebook (version 7.1+).
Additionally, it requires the following Python libraries:

- `numpy` (version 1.26+)
- `scipy` (version 1.12+)
- `matplotlib` (version 3.8+)
- `networkx` (version 3.2+)
- `ipympl` (version 0.9+)
